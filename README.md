-Encapsulating routes
-Managing npm packages and dev dependencies
-Probably other things I don't remember..

My Comments: </br>
This is my 2nd web framework that I'm learning and I've been intrigued and challenged by the new functional way of
thinking that JavaScript requires. I learned it first on client-side and then making a 2nd shift to using JavaScript
server-side was another challenge. </br>

This was helped by the fact that this is the 2nd framework for me so ideas like routing, templating, databases, etc.
are not new. I simply see that each framework handles things a little differently but the fundamental parts are all
the same...facilitating http requests and responses to build a dynamic web application. </br>

**Node's Use of the Terminal:** It is very interesting to use the Unix-base MacOS terminal so heavily. I came into this very comfortable with the terminal and using it in this project was very good for reinforcing that knowledge. I used to hate the terminal and git controls a lot but now that I am decently fast and proficient I see the power of the terminal to interact with my project.
