# NodeCards </br>
**Introduction to Express framework and Node.js with Simple Flashcard Application** </br>

**Instructor/Code:** Andrew Chalkley </br>
**Course Taken:** 11/16/17 - 11/18/17 </br>

**What I Learned:** </br>
-Templating with pug (otherwise know as Jade) </br>
-Module design pattern and exporting encapsulated methods </br>
-Serving static assets to a client </br>
-Encapsulating routes </br>
-Managing npm packages and dev dependencies </br>
-Probably other things I don't remember.. </br>

**My Comments:** </br>
This is my 2nd web framework that I'm learning and I've been intrigued and challenged by the new functional way of
thinking that JavaScript requires. I learned it first on client-side and then making a 2nd shift to using JavaScript
server-side was another challenge. </br>

This was helped by the fact that this is the 2nd framework for me so ideas like routing, templating, databases, etc.
are not new. I simply see that each framework handles things a little differently but the fundamental parts are all
the same...facilitating http requests and responses to build a dynamic web application. </br>

**Node's Use of the Terminal:** It is very interesting to use the Unix-base MacOS terminal so heavily as with Spring I never really used the terminal too much except for git tasks. I came into this very comfortable with the terminal and using it in this project was very good for reinforcing that knowledge. I used to hate the terminal and git controls a lot but now that I am decently fast and proficient I see the power of the terminal to interact with my project.

**Note1:** I didn't upload the node_modules folder into the root here. You can simply automatically create this by running 'node install' to create the node_modules folder needed to load the modules and run the project properly.

**Note2:** This project is really ugly on the frontend. I didn't do the final part that included making css and new html files to make the app look good. I just wanted to learn the data flow and structure of Express so I can cooperate on [NexText's](https://github.com/mwein99/nextext) backend with my colleague [Felipe Linares](https://github.com/felipe-linares) as I only knew Spring Boot for Java and since frontend is the same across frameworks (client-side CSS and JavaScript at least, not dynamic templates).
